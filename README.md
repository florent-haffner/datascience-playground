# Datascience, machine and deep learning playground
> This repository is the first creation of a playground to iterate over small prototypes and expand knowledge nerd_face

We'll explore my subjects of interest :
- basics of regression and classification
- introduction to neural network's via CNN.
- a few NLP exercice
- a few timeseries analysis exercice
- a few scripts to build my own datasets

I'm passionate about the field and for a few year I felt sooooo lost but couldn't help to stop. Now that I have a broad idea of what big-data and data-science is, I want not only be able to solve problems but see the evolution of my knwoledge and technics through time.
It could be very helpful to other student to see how they can solve datascience problems and build machine learning models with different level of knowledge on very different business fields.

# Datascience, machine and deep learning playground
This is what I'm calling a "deterministic data-science sandbox".

The purpose of this repository is to play around on datascience, especially on machine and deep learning technology. We'll apply maths through a few datasets to build an holistic knowledge on the field.

We'll explore my subjects of interest :
- basics of regression and classification
- introduction to neural network's via CNN.
- timeseries prediction via ARIMA and LSTM
- maybe a little automated decision making via Deep reinforcement learning ?
- maybe more later ?!

I'm passionate about the field and for a few year I felt sooooo lost but couldn't help to stop. Now that I have a broad idea of what big-data and data-science is, I want not only be able to solve problems but see the evolution of my knwoledge and technics through time.
It could be very helpful to other student to see how they can solve datascience problems and build machine learning models with different level of knowledge on very different business fields.
